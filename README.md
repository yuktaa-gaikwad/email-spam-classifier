📧 Spam Email Filter using NLP and Machine Learning
This project is an AI-based Spam Email Filter that automatically detects and filters spam emails by analyzing text patterns such as keywords, links, and other linguistic features. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, this filter is designed to achieve high accuracy in identifying spam.

🚀 Key Features
Text Analysis: Extracts and preprocesses email content using techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
Feature Extraction: Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors for analysis.
Classification Algorithms: Implements machine learning models like:
🟢 Naive Bayes: For probabilistic text classification.
🔵 Support Vector Machine (SVM): For separating spam and non-spam emails effectively.
Accuracy Optimization: Fine-tunes models with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
Easy Integration: Can be integrated into email clients or servers for real-time spam detection.
📂 Tech Stack
Language: Python 🐍
Libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy
Algorithms: Naive Bayes, SVM
NLP Techniques: TF-IDF, Tokenization, Stop-word Removal, Stemming
🛠 How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes email content.
Feature Extraction: Applies TF-IDF to transform text into numerical features.
Training: Trains models using labeled email datasets.
Prediction: Classifies incoming emails as spam or non-spam based on trained models.
